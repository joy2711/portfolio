        <li>hello-world.html</li>
        <p>My name is Joy Anne Wairimu Kamau.I just completed my high school studies at Moi Girls High School Kamangu. I then applied to study at Moringa school in order to quench my thirst for computer programming. It is for a fact that I love technology and I have always wanted to be a programmer.</p> 
        <h2> My interesting facts</h2>
        <p>Well, just like any other being, I have somethings that I find interesting and I can do the all day.They include;</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Singing</li>
          <li>SWimming</li>
          <li>Riding</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Apart from that, I also love reading novels and watching movies. I find it interesting and relaxing and whenever I need to take a break, I can just read a novel and when am done I will be fresh and ready to continue  working.Some of the interesting novels that I have read include;</p>
        <ul>
          <li>His property</li>
          <li>Play to kill</li>
          <li>Married by the campus</li>
          <li>Breathless</li>
          <li>What Mey sees</li>
          <li>Hollow</li>
          <li>The list is endless</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I hope to become a succesful programmer one day and I believe I will for success is not for the chosen few but for the few who choose. I think the step that I took when I decided to join Moringa school will take me there someday.</p>
